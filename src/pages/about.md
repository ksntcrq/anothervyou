Travelling is surely escaping from oneâ€™s daily life. However, it is also a mean to better understand it. By comparing various experiences, points of view and ways of life, it is definitely easier to apprehend the society in which we grew up and live. Living in Amsterdam but always seeking new travels, I am therefore writing this blog to everyone who, just like me, are curious about the life that other men and women are living around the world.
